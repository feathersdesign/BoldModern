# The core philosophy of HumanistMin

> These are barebones at the moment, and will be developed further in upcoming commits. As a result, there will be a few of these side notes to explain what will be coming.

The aim of HumanistMin is to make design more functional and user friendly while at the same time making the process of design also designer friendly. In the core philosophy, let's explore how we can make this possible.

## 1. Core tenets

1. Design should be function-first.
2. Design should be easy to make.
3. Design should be easy to use.
4. Design should be easy to recreate.

> I do not ask you to trust me or blindly believe in my vision. You might think design should be aesthetic, not functional, and you wouldn't be alone in that point of view. In my opinion, in the right context, aesthetic is a function by itself. "To please" is a function.

> HumanistMin merely makes my life easier. If it does to you too, cheers. If not, let's talk about it like civilized men and women.

## 2. Recommended fonts and colours

> We will see this section evolve over time, but as we cannot create from nothing, let's go out on a limb and make a few mistakes which we can correct later.

### 2.1 Fonts

As of now, headings will be in `Roboto Bold` and contents will be in `Roboto Regular`. Should fallback gracefully to `Helvetica`, `Arial` or other `sans serif`.
