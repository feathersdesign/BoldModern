# Humanist Min
Humanist Min is a design language being developed by the team at Feathers Design. The language itself is open source and you can feel free to contribute or to use it in your own project. :bowtie:

## What is Humanist Min
Humanist Min is a humanist take on modernist minimalism. While modernism put function first and definitely had its perks, some would comment that it lacked humanism. It was strict and unforgiving. I was a staunch modernist for many years, slowly maturing into a more humane, relatable designer. Note, I'm not saying modernism is bad altogether!
